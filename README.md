# nds-content
This is content created for a class called Network Directory Services, which I taught at the Chippewa Valley Technical College in the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters.

# What audience was this class intended for?
The aim of the class was to develop skills that were needed by future system administrators, IT professionals, and others of various titles within IT.

# Why are you giving it away for free?
There are a number of reasons why I am giving it away. First, I am no longer persuing the field of teaching and I am a firm believer that sharing knowledge is an important part of continuous learning. Second, I technically own the intellectual property rights to this material, so I have decided to just make it open source for everyone! Perhaps it may be of value to others.

# Developing and support of this?
I don't plan on creating anymore material, seeing this was curriculum used for a specific class, but who knows...it could evolve into a much better thing?
